## Installation instructions

For the purposes of this tutorial we will assume you have already installed and logged into Aperture Data Studio.

### Step 1
You will need the jar file for the Consumer View Add-on Step. Download the jar that is given to you by EDQ, and drop it into C:\Program Files\Experian\Aperture Data Studio 1.3.0\addons (the folder name Aperture Data Studio 1.3.0 should end in the version of Aperture Data Studio you are using).

### Step 2
Restart the service by clicking on the user name in the top-right corner and select "Restart service."

You will name the Business Constant EDQ_TOKEN, and the value will be the license key you got during the onboarding process from EDQ.

## Using The Consumer View Add-on Step

### Step 1
When using the Consumer View Step, you must have your table data tagged.
Instructions on how to data tag your tables is located in the [Aperture Data Studio User Guide](https://www.edq.com/documentation/aperture-data-studio/user-guide/#data-tagging).

Once you tagged the table, the header should look like this header with word bubbles in the tagged headers:

### Step 2
After data tagging the table, create your workflow in the Workflow Designer.

### Step 6
Once you have finished configuring your workflow, you can click on "Show data" to see the results.

## Troubleshooting

1. Leading Zero Missing

Data Studio will sometimes remove leading zeros for standardization. It is important to avoid this on the zip code/postal code column, as the API relies on a full zip code to make a match. To maintain leading zeros, go to Data Explorer and right click on the file. In the drop down menu, select "Preview and configure". Right click on the zip code/postal code column and select "Edit." In the pop up window, turn off all standardization options for that column by toggling each switch into the "Off" position.

## FAQs

1. What columns to tag?

The more columns you tag the better the result will be. However, you must you at least these Data Tags: Forename, Surname, Zip Code/Postal Code, and Country.

2. Why do I only get data back for US records?

This Integration only works for USA data.
